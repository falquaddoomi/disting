DISTING: model indistinguishability identifier
====

This project aims to provide a means to identify the family of compartment models that are indistinguishable from a given model, via both graph-theoretic
and moment-invariant techniques. The project provides a website (implemented in the Django framework) which is used as an interface to the processing pipeline (implemented via Celery, a distributed task queue processor.)

To run your own version of the site, you should do the following:

1) Set up your build environment. On Ubuntu, the command to install the relevant packages is the following:

sudo apt-get install python python-pip rabbitmq-server maxima

2) Set up and populate your virtualenv, like so:

sudo pip install virtualenv
virtualenv disting_env
source disting_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Run the DISTING components using screen, which will set up a session from which you can monitor the various processes:

screen -S disting -c server_screen

At this point, you should have a screen session running with three subscreens: server, which is the webserver,
processor, which is the
